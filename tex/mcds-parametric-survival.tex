\section{Parametric Models, Penalization, and Sample Size}

Here are a few odds and ends that may answer some of the questions you still have about Cox models.

\subsection{Parametric Survival Models}

The Cox model makes no assumptions about the baseline hazard except that it does not vary based on the values of the covariates. That makes it extremely useful for estimating the effects of different coefficients, but it also reduces its utility for prediction. By making assumptions about the shape of the baseline hazard, we get a fully parameterized model 

Although we haven't gotten into confidence intervals and hypothesis
