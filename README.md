These are some notes for "Modern Clinical Data Science", a pilot course and discussion group for data-science-interested physicians and colleagues in the Dept. of Medicine at Mount Sinai. This is a working document, will evolve over time, and will almost definitely contain errors. It is not a textbook. It's designed to provide content that can guide discussions of different machine learning, statistics, and general data science topics.

If you see *DRAFT* in big, red letters at the top of the chapter, it means that chapter is still incomplete. 

Also, at some point I will post links here to videos of me pontificating about the different discussion questions. That probably won't happen for awhile.
