# mcds-notes

These are some notes for "Modern Clinical Data Science", a pilot course and discussion group for data-science-interested physicians and colleagues in the Dept. of Medicine at Mount Sinai. This is a working document, will evolve over time, and will almost definitely contain errors. It is not a textbook. It's designed to provide content that can guide discussions of different machine learning, statistics, and general data science topics.

If you see an asterisk by the chapter name, it means that chapter is a bit more advanced/mathematical. If you see *DRAFT* in big, red letters, it means that chapter is still incomplete. 

When the notes are in a relatively stable form, I will post links here to videos of me talking through the different discussion questions.
