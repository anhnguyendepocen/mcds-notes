# mcds-notes

These are some notes for "Modern Clinical Data Science", a pilot course and discussion group for data-science-interested physicians and colleagues in the Dept. of Medicine at Mount Sinai. This is a working document, will evolve over time, and will almost definitely contain errors. It is not a textbook. It's designed to provide content that can guide discussions of different machine learning, statistics, and general data science topics.

### Chapters that contain mostly conceptual material suitable for everyone:
- Probability Distributions (Ch. 1)
- Hypothesis Testing (Ch. 3)
- Classification (Ch. 4)
- The Bias-Variance Tradeoff (Ch. 6)
- Regression (Ch. 7)
- Fitting and Interpreting GLMs (Ch. 10)
- Decision Trees (Ch. 12)
- Random Forests (Ch. 13)
- Missing Data (Ch. 15)

### Chapters that contain a higher level of mathematical detail:
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Ch. 2)
- Logistic Regression (Ch. 5)
- Linear Regression (Ch. 8)
- Generalized Linear Models (Ch. 9)
- Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net (Ch. 11)
- Boosting (Ch. 14)

If you see *DRAFT* in big, red letters at the top of the chapter, it means that chapter is still incomplete.
